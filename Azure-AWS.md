# Azure - AWS


```
Azure Functions and AWS Lambda are both serverless computing services that allow you to run code without managing the underlying infrastructure. However,
they are part of different cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, respectively) and have some differences in terms of features,
integrations, and pricing. Here's a comparison between Azure Functions and AWS Lambda:
```

|Service | Description | Azure                      | AWS                      |
|-------|--------- |------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
|Virtual servers|  Allows users to deploy, manage, and maintain OS and server software; instance types provide configurations of CPU/RAM | Virtual Machine  | Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 |
|Container management| Supports Docker/Kubernetes containers and allows users to run applications on managed instance clusters | EC2 Container Service (ECS)

|||Azure Functions: Supports multiple programming languages including C#, F#, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, Java, and more.  | AWS Lambda: Supports languages such as Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, .NET Core, and custom runtimes using the Runtime API. |
||| Azure Functions: Integrates well with other Azure services and provides seamless connectivity with Azure Logic Apps, Event Grid, and other Azure components.  | AWS Lambda: Integrates with various AWS services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and more. It also allows custom integrations with other AWS services. |
||| Azure Functions: Supports a variety of triggers, including HTTP triggers, timer triggers, message-based triggers using Azure Service Bus, Azure Event Hubs, and more | AWS Lambda: Triggers can be events from different AWS services, such as changes in an S3 bucket, updates to DynamoDB tables, or API Gateway invocations |
|||Provides the option of running functions in a dedicated App Service plan or a consumption plan where resources are allocated dynamically based on demand  | Automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests, and you pay only for the compute time consumed |
||| Generally has a slightly higher cold start time compared to AWS Lambda | Known for its fast cold start times, making it suitable for scenarios where low latency is crucial. |
||| Pricing is based on execution time and resource consumption | Pricing is based on the number of requests and the compute time required to run the code |
||| Growing ecosystem and community with strong integration into Microsoft technologies. |  Mature ecosystem with extensive community support and integration with a wide range of AWS services |
