Azure Functions and AWS Lambda are both serverless computing services that allow you to run code without managing the underlying infrastructure. However,
they are part of different cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, respectively) and have some differences in terms of features,
integrations, and pricing. Here's a comparison between Azure Functions and AWS Lambda:
```

| Azure Functions                     | AWS lambda                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Azure Functions: Supports multiple programming languages including C#, F#, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, Java, and more.  | AWS Lambda: Supports languages such as Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, .NET Core, and custom runtimes using the Runtime API. |
| Azure Functions: Integrates well with other Azure services and provides seamless connectivity with Azure Logic Apps, Event Grid, and other Azure components.  | AWS Lambda: Integrates with various AWS services like Amazon S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and more. It also allows custom integrations with other AWS services. |
